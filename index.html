            his MD (also at the Waterloo Regional Campus), he received his
            Bachelor of Science from the University of Guelph and worked for
            two years as a medical secretary and transcriptionist where he
            developed interests in eHealth and telemedicine. Having also grown
            up in KW, Eric is excited to help support the evolution of the
            region's medical technology sector. You can usually find Eric
            playing racquet sports, trying new escape rooms, or more likely,

            as a senior tax associate at PwC LLP. Mei hopes to use her
            background in business and medicine to help guide new initiatives
            in the medtech space. She is also interested in ways technology
            can be leveraged to transform healthcare to be more time and
            cost-efficient. Outside of work, Mei can be found
            travelling/eating, slowly watching Star Trek TNG, or playing
            squash.

          <h3>Candice Griffin</h3>

          <p>Candice is a first year internal medicine resident at McMaster’s Waterloo Regional Campus. Prior to
            medicine she worked in marketing and design, and was the creator and developer of evitality.ca, a
            locally-based e-commerce website that featured medically directed health, wellness and beauty products.
            After deciding to pursue a career in medicine, she then completed a bachelor of science at the University
            of
            Waterloo and subsequently attended medical school at McMaster University. She hopes to combine her past
            interests in information technology with her current life in medicine to hopefully innovate healthcare in
            Canada, improving patient safety and outcomes. In her spare time she enjoys horse-training, mountain
            biking
            and hiking with her dogs.
